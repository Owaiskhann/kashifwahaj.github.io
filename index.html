	<h2>My Expertise</h2>
	<p id="p">I've got chops in all phases of the design process</p>
	<div id="iuc">
		<div id="ideas"><div></div>
		<h1>Ideas</h1>
		<p>I collaborate with clients and peers to nurture and transform ideas into well thought out design specs. After all, that's where the majority of amazing user experiences start.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="ui"><div></div>
		<h1>UI</h1>
		<p>I sketch and wireframe interfaces focusing on content structure, intuitive UI patterns and simple interactions. I'm a minimalist who truly believes that less is more.</p></div>
		<div id="code"><div></div>
		<h1>Code</h1>
		<p>I design in the browser with HTML(5), CSS(3) and a touch of JavaScript. I love coding things from scratch, but I can work with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap too.</p></div>
